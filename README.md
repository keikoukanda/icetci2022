# About Conference
The Second International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence, ICETCI 2022 will be held at Mahindra University, Hyderabad, India, from August 25 to 27, 2022. The conference will consist of one day of tutorial sessions followed by two days of keynote lectures by invited experts and technical paper presentations by practitioners. We invite submission of papers from all areas of Computational Intelligence, both emerging topics which form the theme of the conference as well as more established areas, presenting developments in algorithms as well as applications. All papers will pass through a multiple peer-review process, and accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xploreâ€™s scope and quality requirements.
